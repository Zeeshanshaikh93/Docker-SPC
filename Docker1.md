# Docker

* What is Docker?
* Docker is an open-source platform designed for building, deploying, and managing applications within lightweight, portable containers.
* Overview of Docker,
      Containerization: Docker allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into standardized units called containers. This encapsulation ensures that applications run consistently across different environments, whether on a developer's local machine, in a data center, or in the cloud.
      Efficiency: Unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs), which require a full operating system to run each application, Docker containers share the host operating system's kernel. This results in lower resource usage and faster startup times, making Docker a more efficient solution for deploying applications.
      Portability: Docker containers can be easily moved between different environments without compatibility issues. This portability simplifies the process of deploying applications across various platforms.
* Key Components,
      Docker Engine: The core component that enables container management. It consists of a server-side daemon that handles container creation and management, and a client-side command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
      Docker Images: Read-only templates used to create containers. An image contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, libraries, and environment settings .
      Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry where Docker images can be stored and shared. It allows users to pull images for use or push their own images for distribution .
      Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications using a simple YAML file. It simplifies the management of complex applications that consist of multiple interconnected services.
